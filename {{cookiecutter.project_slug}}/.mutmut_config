# Mutation testing verifies that your tests actually catch bugs by introducing
# small changes (mutations) to your code and checking if tests fail.
#
# Usage:
#   mutmut run            # Run mutation testing
#   mutmut results        # Show results summary
#   mutmut show <id>      # Show details of a specific mutant
#   mutmut html           # Generate HTML report

# Mutation Testing - NOT CONFIGURED
#
# To enable mutation testing, set include_mutation_testing to "yes"
# in cookiecutter.json when generating the project.
#
# Mutation testing helps verify test quality by:
# 1. Making small changes (mutations) to your code
# 2. Running tests to see if they catch the mutation
# 3. Reporting a "mutation score" (% of mutations caught)
#
# A high mutation score indicates your tests effectively catch bugs.
