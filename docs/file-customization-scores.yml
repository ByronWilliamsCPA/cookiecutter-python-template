# File Customization Score Tracking
# =================================
# This file tracks which template-generated files are likely to be customized
# by downstream projects. Use this to determine which files should be managed
# via the .standards/ two-part system.
#
# Scoring System (1-5):
#   1 - Never edited: Config/tooling files that work as-is
#   2 - Rarely edited: May need minor tweaks for edge cases
#   3 - Sometimes edited: Projects may add sections or modify behavior
#   4 - Often edited: Most projects customize these significantly
#   5 - Always edited: Every project must customize (project-specific content)
#
# Threshold Logic:
#   - Score >= 4: Should be in .standards/ with baseline files
#   - Score 3: Monitor feedback, candidate for .standards/
#   - Score <= 2: Safe to update directly via cruft
